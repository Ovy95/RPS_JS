# RPS_JS
Recreation of ROCK PAPER SCISSORS game

I decided to re-create the RPS game, to help development my process using Javascript. Also to get used to using Jasmine Testing frameworks again. 

The last couple of commits are drying up the code. Having more methods then needed to determine outcome of the Game. I changed the process to using a object  properties instead of using comparisons. This dried up the code.
